<h4>How it works</h4>
<div class="category spacer">Don't throw away an old phone</div>
<p>No ! There may be people who want to re-use your old phone. Instead of throwing it away, why don't you
just sell it? </p>
<p>We'd love to have your old phone on here !</p>

<div class="category spacer">People can buy it</div>
<p>When your phone is on the application, other people will be able to see it. They can send you
and e-mail or facebook message.</p>
<p>You'll get some money for your old phone and they have a have a new phone, awesome !</p>

<div class="category spacer">My phone is broken</div>
<p>Well, that sucks. But, maybe you'r able to find a repair café here, or maybe someone who repairs stuff in his spare time ?</p>
<p>Repair Cafés are free meeting places and they’re all about repairing things (together). In the place where a Repair Café is located, you’ll find tools and materials to help you make any repairs you need.<p>
<p>The best part: it's free !</p>
