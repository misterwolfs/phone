<p>Well, that sucks. But, maybe you're able to find a repair café here, or maybe someone who repairs stuff in his spare time ?</p>
<p>Repair Cafés are free meeting places and they’re all about repairing things (together). In the place where a Repair Café is located, you’ll find tools and materials to help you make any repairs you need.<p>
<p>The best part: it's free !</p>
